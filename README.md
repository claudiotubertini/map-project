# map-project
## Introduction
The application shows a Google Map and a side box with a search form. The map of a european small town loads with a series of restaurants. You can search the places with a text input form and retrieve reviews using the web site [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/).
## Description of the application
The main file with the view is `index.html`. The model, the viewmodel and the constructor of the Google Map are in `js/neighborhood-map.js`. The features style of the map is in `js/map.js`. The style of the application is in `css/map.css`.
The application make use of jquery, bootstrap and, above all, knockoutjs. In the javascript folder `js` there is also a file `oauth-signature.min.js` for the connection to Yelp API.
When you load `index.html` a series of markers appear in the map. Their position and name are hard coded in an array. When a marker is clicked an infowindow appears that shows a nearby streetview. The markers change colours moving the mouse over and out of them.
In the panel box on the side of the map there is the list of all the places. You can search and filter the markers writing in the input box. Clicking on the name of the place you have chosen, again the infowindow in the map opens and meanwhile a review coming from Yelp web site, and the url, is loaded in the sidebox. The search on Yelp site through their API is based on the name of the restaurant on which you have clicked.
